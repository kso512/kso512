## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cybersecurity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source software.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving the code in my repositories.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about code I wrote over 20 years ago that's still in production.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
  - [Create an issue here](https://github.com/kso512/kso512/issues)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I was paid to professionaly scare people at a haunted house, but the best role was "audience plant" where I would dress as a paying member of the public and interact with the other actors in ways the normal public could not.  For example: being dragged over the railing and acting like I was being disemboweled. Corallary fun fact: no one ever tried to help; they all just ran away screaming!
  - I was paid to boil water for the U.S. Navy (in a nuclear submarine) but the most fun was acting in drills as a "gone crazy shipmate" - then seeing how the other sailors reacted.
